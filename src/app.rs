            "For some reason I always end up writing stuff related to types, schemas and DX. I started out writing C# in my spare time while playing with Unity, and later got a job writing .NET apps for Akind Group (formerly Academic Work). As a beginner I really appreciated the auto-completion and friendly compiler messages. To recreate the feeling of rapid iteration in a Unity project for mobile phones, I learned about reflection and runtime type inspection in order to build a UI overlay to tweak all of my in-game parameters. This was a good stepping stone into TypeScript later on, where the abstraction layers became even more obvious."

            "Lately I've been growing more and more weary of TypeScript and it's flaky ecosystem, and have been getting more and more into Rust. In fact, this website is written entirely without JavaScript (well, besides some Tailwind shenanigans), using Leptos in SSR mode. My editor of choice is Helix."
